# Indian States Name Guessing Quiz

Welcome to the Indian States Name Guessing Quiz! This GitHub repository hosts an interactive quiz that challenges players to guess the names of Indian states by typing them in a typing area. Built using Python, Turtle, and Pandas, this project is perfect for intermediate-level developers interested in exploring Indian geography while having fun.

## Overview

The Indian States Name Guessing Quiz displays a political map of India on the screen. Players are prompted to type the name of an Indian state in the typing area. If the entered name matches an Indian state, it is shown on the map above the corresponding state. The quiz is a delightful way to test and improve your knowledge of Indian states.

## Technologies Used

The Indian States Name Guessing Quiz project harnesses the following technologies:

- **Python:** The core language that powers the game logic and controls the flow of the application.

- **Turtle:** Used to create the graphical user interface, including the political map of India.

- **Pandas:** Utilized to manage data related to Indian states, such as the list of state names.

## End of Game

The Indian States Name Guessing Quiz provides three ways to end the game:

1. **Automatically:** If you correctly guess all the state names, the game ends automatically.

2. **Explicit Exit:** If you want to end the game explicitly, type "exit" in the typing area, and the game will conclude.

3. **Quitting the Game:** If you quit the game, a file containing the names of the states you missed is saved. This provides an opportunity to review and improve your knowledge for future quizzes.
